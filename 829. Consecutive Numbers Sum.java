/* Given a positive integer N, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 = 5 = 2 + 3

Example 2:
Input: 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4
*/

/* thinking: N can be expressed as k + 1, k + 2, ..., k + i, where k is a positive integer; 
therefore N = k * i + (i + 1) * i / 2 => N - (i + 1) * i / 2 = k * i, 
which implies that as long as N - (i + 1) * i / 2 is k times of i, 
we get a solution corresponding to i; 
Hence iteration of all possible values of i, starting from 1, will cover all cases of the problem.
Since for i = 1, N can always be written as one number sequence: N, we can start from i = 2, res = 1.
