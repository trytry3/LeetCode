## Graph
#### MST (minimum spanning tree):
- [Kruskal’s algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-2-kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-mst/)
- [Prim's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-5-prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-2/)

#### Detect cycle in an undirected graph
- [Union-Find](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/)

#### Finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph
- BFS is the algorithm to use if we want to find the shortest path in an *undirected*, *unweighted* graph. The claim for BFS is that the first time a node is discovered during the traversal, that distance from the source would give us the shortest path.
  
- [Dijkstra’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a *weighted* graph
   
   Note: the difference between Dijkstra and BFS is that Dijkstra uses heap, while BFS uses queue
