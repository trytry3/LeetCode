## Graph
#### MST (minimum spanning tree):
- [Kruskal’s algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-2-kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-mst/)
- [Prim's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-5-prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-2/)

#### Detect cycle in an undirected graph
- [Union-Find](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/)

#### Finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph
- [Dijkstra’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
   Note: the difference between Dijkstra and BFS is that Dijkstra uses heap, while BFS uses queue
